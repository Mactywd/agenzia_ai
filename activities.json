The ancient Roman dinner will be held in an elegant apartment located just a few steps from the Colosseum  following the ancient Roman receips of Marcus Gavius Apicius, gastronome, cook and Roman writer who lived at the turn of the first and second century A.D. He wrote the oldest Roman cookery receips book  \u201c The res coquinaria\u201d . In the res coquinaria are described dishes that served to make the banquests of Roman nobles and aristocrats unique and special for showing their power and magnificence on the other foreign guests.  During the ancient Roman dinner will be described dishes and the ancient Roman techniques of their preparation. Will follow the reading of the classic texts of the ancient Roman cuisine such as  the famed the dinner of \u201cTrimalchone\u201d narrated in the Satyricon of Petronio and the famous lustful Lucullian dinner narrated by Plutarch interpreted by our expert archaeology lecturer Claudia Pinci accompained by the sound of the traditional ancient roman music .",
